# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
Stateful components have state and keep track of data, while functional components do not have state and print out what is given using props.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?
The function componentWillMount is called before rendering takes place, while the function componentWillUpdate is called after changes are made.

3. Define stateful logic.
Stateful logic is code that maipulates data.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
Arrange, Act, and Assert are the three steps, where we arrange the component being tested, act upon the execution, and assert a response.
